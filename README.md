This is a collection point for the notes, photos, and final report for the IEEE Smart Village 2024 trip to Alaska. 

## Interactive Map

Apologies if this is the case] To see an interactive map of our project site-visits, as well as DOE/Launch Alaska Energyshed project locations, and Generation sources around the state of Alaska, go to this link: https://overview-solutions.github.io/AlaskaEnergy/
